## WiFi clock - custom firmware for EleksTube IPS clock

Thanks to [Mark Smith](https://github.com/SmittyHalibut) for [EleksTubeHAX](https://github.com/SmittyHalibut/EleksTubeHAX). It comes with the hardware details and working Arduino code.

This project is based on platformio and the goal is to offer a self-contained WiFi clock with a web server that can be used to update the style and setup the clock (wifi details, NTP, timezone, daylight, etc.).
