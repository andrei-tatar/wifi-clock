Thanks to [Mark Smith](https://github.com/SmittyHalibut) for [EleksTubeHAX](https://github.com/SmittyHalibut/EleksTubeHAX). It comes with the hardware details and working Arduino code.

This project is based on platformio and the goal is to offer a self-contained WiFi clock with a web server that can be used to update the style and setup the clock (wifi details, NTP, timezone, daylight, etc.).

If you like the project, find it useful and want to support me, consider donating [PayPal](https://paypal.me/andreitatar).
